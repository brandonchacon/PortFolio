    My name brandon chacon and am a highschool student in timberline boise school district planning to have a career in chemical engineering. So to fill the rest of the paragraph i've copied my constructed response from english.First Don Tapsscott explains that technology is changing the world and that the new generation has no fear of using tech. Now he tells us the first principle is collaboration that when you need help there are others willing to do so for you with no problem. Then with collaboration he gives a anecdote about his neighbor becoming rich by getting help from the whole world leading him to great fortune. Then after collaboration he says transparency is another factor to technology. He says that if a company makes good business it will become less transparent to the whole world and will try to learn more about it and what they do and expose what they really do behind your back. An example he makes is when you start off you have to have good products like being buff physically and have structural integrity to yourself and your company. Thirdly he says sharing, embracing the commons, giving up assets to help others. He tells us that if will help others we will get an outcome that will help even more people and yourself to succeed. Then tells us an example that if a pharmacist has 10% of a curable disease and another pharmacist  has the same they should work together to get a better solution rather keeping a piece of an unfinished puzzle. Lastly is empowerment, the distribution of power using technology. He explains us that the technology we have can help others that don’t have the information as we do can succeed a following goal together like or as collaboration. Lead this is an example from him where in siria people who couldn’t tell where a shot came from can take a picture and send it to the military to find where it came from. He finishes off with all these examples and explanation about it that upon this world there will be a new age of everything.

     Skills on trying to finish this sentence in one minute or less. Also using one my famous code from code.org right here.size(400,400);
     background(0,0,255);
     for(int i=5;i<400;i++){
       stroke(10+i,20+i,30+i);
       line(-100+i,0,0+i,400+i);
     
     }
     size(400,400);
     background(255,0,0);
     for(int i=10;i<400;i++){
       strokeWeight(1);
     arc(0+i,0+i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(0+i,400-i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(300+i,100+i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(0+i,300-i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(100+i,300+i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(0+i,200-i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(150+i,75+i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(0+i,100-i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(75+i,150+i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(0+i,0-i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     }
     for(int i=10;i<400;i++){
     arc(200+i,200+i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(0+i,300+i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     arc(325+i,25+i,100,100,radians(0),radians(360));
     }
